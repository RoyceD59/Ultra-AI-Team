      {
        heading: 'Is Nairobi tap water safe to drink straight?',
        body: "Nairobi Water & Sewerage Company (NWSC) treats mains water with chlorine to kill bacteria before it leaves the treatment plant. However, by the time it reaches your tap — through ageing pipes, storage tanks, and distribution infrastructure — contamination from bacteria (E. coli, coliforms) and turbidity is common, particularly after heavy rain or supply disruptions. Ultra Clear filters remove these risks at the point of use.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'What does Ultra Clear actually remove?',
        body: "The Ahlstrom Disruptor® filter (in all bottle products and the Sweet Home) is SGS-certified to remove:\n• >99.9% of bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae)\n• >99.9% of protozoa (Giardia, Cryptosporidium)\n• Chlorine taste and odour\n• Sediment and particulates\n\nIt does NOT remove dissolved salts, minerals (calcium, magnesium), fluoride, or viruses. For borehole water with high mineral content or fluoride, the Counter RO or RO Home System provides full TDS reduction.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Is borehole water safe?',
        body: "Many Nairobi estates rely on borehole water, particularly during NWSC supply disruptions. Borehole water is typically lower in bacteria than surface water but may contain elevated fluoride (especially in Rift Valley geology areas), nitrates, and dissolved minerals. Filtering with an Ultra Clear bottle or faucet filter removes bacteria and turbidity. For full dissolved-solids reduction from borehole water, the Counter Reverse Osmosis or RO Home System is recommended.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'What about surface water (rivers, dams)?',
        body: 'Surface water such as Nairobi River, Mbagathi, and seasonal streams carries high bacterial loads, turbidity, and chemical runoff — especially near agricultural or urban areas. The Survivor Straw and EcoSmart Elite are certified for field use with surface water. For sustained household use, surface water should be pre-settled and then filtered through the EcoSmart Elite or a whole-home RO system.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'Does the filter remove fluoride?',
        body: 'The Ahlstrom Disruptor® cartridge does not remove dissolved fluoride. If you are in a high-fluoride area (parts of Rift Valley, central Kenya highlands), use the Counter Reverse Osmosis or RO Home System, which includes an RO membrane rated to reduce fluoride to safe levels.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'How much water can the filter process per day?',
        body: "There is no daily limit — the filter is rated by total volume (e.g. 150 litres per cartridge for bottles) rather than daily throughput. A household of 4 using a Sweet Home faucet filter for drinking and cooking uses approximately 8–12 litres per day, giving a cartridge life of 4–5 months at that rate.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'My filter is certified — what does SGS certification mean?',
        body: "SGS is the world's leading testing and certification company. SGS certification means an independent laboratory has physically tested Ultra Clear filters and confirmed they achieve the claimed performance (e.g. >99.9% bacteria removal) against the NSF/ANSI P231 standard for microbiological water purifiers. This is independent of Ultra Clear's own claims.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Can I use my filter during a boil-water advisory?',
        body: "During an official boil-water advisory (typically issued when E. coli is detected in distribution mains), Ultra Clear filters certified to >99.9% bacteria removal provide effective protection. However, as an abundance of caution, we recommend boiling filtered water during active advisories — particularly for infants, elderly users, or immunocompromised individuals. The filter is not a substitute for official public-health guidance.",
